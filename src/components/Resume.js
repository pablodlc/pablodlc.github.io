                                                Write technical, instructional documentation primarily for use in Production, such as assembling, calibrating, casing, and inspecting Alicatâ€™s devices.  Liaise with co-workers in all departments and at all levels to gather pertinent information for documentation.

                                                <br />

                                                Key Accomplishments:

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>	Formerly the Calibration Supervisor, in charge of training and supervising calibration technicians. In order to attend the University of Arizona Coding Boot Camp, I stepped down from this role and resumed working as a Calibrator and was subsequently offered the role of Technical Writer.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Calibration: Trainer-level knowledge and experience of calibrating Alicat's mass-flow product line. I have calibrated approximately 20,000 Alicat devices, nearly twice that of the next highest outputting calibrator. One of less than a half-dozen Alicat employees with experience calibrating Alicat's BASIS line. Familiarity with basic pressure and liquid calibration fundamentals and procedures.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Quality Inspection: One of the approximately half-dozen onsite employees able to Inspect in the American facility nearing 100 employees; occasionally filling in such role as needed.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Head Assembly Calibrator: Head Assemblies are the pre-calibrated sensor/main board packages used in over 90% of Alicat's product line. Before calibration, I worked as the only full-time employee in Head Assembly at that time. I produced over 100 head assemblies daily, keeping units on hand in advance for a projected seven day safety stock.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        RMA (Service): experience working with the Service department, where repairs and re-calibrations occur.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Assembly: able to assemble nearly all Alicat devices at the senior Production employee level. This includes screwing together stainless steel components and fine soldering skills to wire PCBs together, or change tiny components, like resistors, capacitors, and diodes.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Non-Job Tract: Non-Jobs are builds that serve as components used in Alicat devices. This includes assembling proprietary valves, coiling bobbins with magnetic wire for use in valves, soldering a wide variety of communication cables, building BB9 communication boxes, and other such parts used as components in the assembly of the product line.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <li>
                                                        Casing: able to case any Alicat device in less time than allotted, typically in half the expected time.
                                                    </li>
