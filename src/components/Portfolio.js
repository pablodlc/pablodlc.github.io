                                        Welcome to my portfolio.
                                        I am new to programming, but in a short time I've been able to make a decent portfolio of which I'm proud. I chose to introduce you to my work with a couple of group projects. The first is group project 2 of 3 from my boot camp called <span className="title">My Movie List</span>. This project follows the MVC framework and uses Sequelize to store a database. <span className="title">Trivia with a Twist!</span> is my first group project from the boot camp, where we utilized two server-side APIs to create quiz application. The next piece is I'm including is <span className="title">budget-tracker</span>, my first PWA--which means it works without an internet connection and can be installed as its own app on most smart devices. Even though it's not a deployed application, I waned to showcase my backend skills with <span className="title">soc-net</span>. <span className="title">soc-net</span> is a social networking backend application that stores Users and Friends, as we'll as Users' Thoughts and friends' Reactions to those Thoughts with MongooseDB. The next piece is <span className="title">Work Day Scheduler</span>, where I utilized two APIs to create a simple app that shows weather conditions of cities based on the user's input. <span className="title">Ramones</span>. Seriously, that page is great if only because of its subject.

Users can create lists, like other users' lists, comment on others' lists as well as their own.

                                        This the first of three group project assignment. Here, two classmates and I made a drinking trivia application. We were to use at least two server- side APIs, local storage, and have it be interactive. We made this good looking, fun application that generates random drinks and runs through a 5 question general knowledge trivia game, each using a different API.

Users can post Thoughts that other users can read and to which post a Reaction. Additionally, Users can friend one another, adding each other to their friend arrays. Because this is just a backend application, there is no deployed site to visit, but please visit my YouTube channel to see it in action!
