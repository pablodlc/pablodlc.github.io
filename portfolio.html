                        Welcome to my portfolio. <br />
                        I am new to programming, but in a short time I've been
                        able to make a decent portfolio of which I'm proud. I
                        chose to introduce you to my work with a group project
                        we called Trivia with a Twist! The next piece is a
                        password generator application, a study in JavaScript.
                        After my Password Generator, I've included an
                        application that taught me about using local storage and
                        Moment.js, a fun JavaScript library, called Work Day
                        Scheduler. A similar application follows, called
                        Taskmaster Pro Edition. In it I learned about jQuery,
                        Moment.js, and advanced styling. Run Buddy was a
                        step-by-step, module-led build. I learned about basic
                        webpage structuring and refined styling in this lesson .
                        Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n was my first homework
                        assignment, a refactor challenge to make the landing
                        page more accessible. Ramones. Seriously, that page is
                        great if only because of its subject.

                    classmates and I made a full-stack application that uses its
                    own server and OMDB API for some movie data. Users can
                    create lists, like other users' lists, comment on others'

                    This the first of three group project assignment. Here, two
                    classmates and I made a drinking trivia application. We were
                    to use at least two server-side APIs, local storage, and
                    have it be interactive. We made this good looking, fun
                    application that generates random drinks and runs through a
                    5 question general knowledge trivia game, each using a
                    different API.

                        results, view this page between the hours of 10:00 A.M.
                        and 4 P.M. That allows you to see all three background
                        colors that dynamically update.

                        A vanilla HTML fan page for the greatest band of all
                        time. Ever. This was a pre-work assignment for my boot
                        camp to familiarize us with basic HTML. I include it
                        because, mostly, it's the Ramones. But also to
                        demonstrate my earliest efforts.
                    </p>
