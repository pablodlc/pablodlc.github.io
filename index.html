                <p>
                    Hello World! My name is Pablo and I'm a fledgling
                    programmer. I have a varied background; food service,
                    retail, social work, law, and currently manufacturing. I
                    made a cookie cutter webpage long ago and thought it was
                    great fun. Somehow it never occurred to me that I could
                    enjoy it professionally. I'm enthusiastically learning new
                    technologies and concepts. I definitely consider myself a
                    full-stack programmer, as I thoroughly enjoy making a site
                    look good and do cool things and equally enjoy communicating
                    with server-side APIs.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As of now, spring of 2021, I am familiar with building a
                    webpage from scratch. I love JavaScript and how much I can
                    make a page do or elements I can change dynamically by
                    simple user input. jQuery is a handy shorthand I'm
                    familiarizing myself with and using often. I can use CDNs to
                    customize my font and include sharp looking icons, I can
                    fetch data from server-side APIs and return it to a page.
                    I'm also gaining experience in JavaScript libraries, like
                    Moment.js, and CSS frameworks, specifically Bootstrap and
                    Bulma.

            <p id="portfolio-text">
                Welcome to my portfolio. <br />
                I am new to programming, but in a short time, I've been able to
                make a decent portfolio. I chose to introduce you to my work
                with a group project we called Trivia with a Twist! The next
                piece is a password generator application, a study in
                JavaScript. Two of my portfolio items are class assignments.
                After my Password Generator, I've included an application that
                taught me about using local storage and Moment.js, a new, fun
                JavaScript library, called Work Day Scheduler. A similar
                application follows, called Taskmaster Pro Edition. In it I
                learned about jQuery, Moment.js, and advanced styling. Run Buddy
                was a step-by-step, module-led build. I learned about basic
                webpage structuring in this lesson. Hori<span class="seo"
                    >seo</span
                >n was a refactor challenge to make the landing page more
                accessible. That lesson taught me the importance of
                accessability in websites, using simple elements like semantic
                HTML and alt tags in images. Ramones. Seriously, that page is
                great if only because of its subject.

                    This is a group project assignment where two classmates and
                    I made and drinking trivia application. We were to use at
                    least two server-side APIs, local storage, and have it be
                    interactive. We made this good looking, fun application that
                    generates random drinks and runs through a 5 question
                    general knowledge trivia game, each using a different API.

                    <p>
                        A vanilla HTML fanpage for the greatest band of all
                        time. Ever. One of my earliest assignments, subtly
                        portending to the heights I would achieve.
