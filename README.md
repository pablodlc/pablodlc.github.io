## Future Developments

My ideas for future developments on **budget-tracker** would be to add security to keep users' financial interests private by means of a login and password. I would then have the option to create budgets so that users could track multiple budgets with one account. Eventually linking budgets to one master table would be a great feature. This would let users manage sub-budgets connected to a master budget. However, the most lacking feature is a way to clear the database from the application.
