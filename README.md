## Description

This is my portfolio, a React app with two page elements and four pages:

-   **Page Elements**  
    There are two page elements that appear on every page: the `Navbar` and the `Footer`. - `Navbar`: a responsive Navbar with my name, which works as a link to the home page. There are also links to the corresponding `li`s `Portfolio`, `Resume`, and `Contact Me`. Each of the links have a fun hover effect that change the font to _Creepster_. - `Footer`: My `Footer` is lovingly borrowed from _Horiseon_, the first assignment in my coding boot camp.
-   **Pages**
    -   `Home`: `Home` is the homepage of my portfolio page with an image of yours truly and a brief bio.

    -   `Portfolio`: I use this page to showcase my work. I have a card welcoming the user to my portfolio followed by six featured projects; each of which are in a formatted React-Bootstrap Card. Within the `Card`, there is a `Card.Title` which contains the project name and doubles as a link to the deployed application. Next is an image of the application. Below that, is a brief description of the project.

    -   `Resume`: Below the _My Resume_ headline, is another header that is a link to download a .pdf copy of my resume. Below that link is a Bootstrap Card I formatted as a resume.

    -   `Contact Me`: My `Contact Me` page resourcefully reuses the format from Home. After some brief text are three links: two that open my [GitHub](https://github.com/pablodlc) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablodlc) profiles respectively, and the third is a [`mailto`](mailto:pablodlc@gmail.com) link that sends to my email address.

    -   `index.html`: I included a little error handling by adding an `index.html` component when a user navigates to pablodlc.github.io/index.html.

## Future Developments

1. 9/02/2021: Now that the app is acceptably responsive, I'm going to fine tune some features.

    - `/portfolio`: The `My Work` card is too long for screens smaller than 768px wide. I'll create a new, abbreviated card for medium screen sizes and smaller.
    - `/resume`: The resume I wrote for the front-end of my page gets squished and unpleasant to read at smaller breakpoints. I'm going to create a breakpoint rule to hide the resume on medium screen sizes and smaller.

1. A feature I'd like to add is a hover effect on my mug shot on the Home and Contact pages, where mousing over the picture reveals a pic of me looking extremely unkempt.

1. **PWA**: Although there is no need for this application to be a Progressive Web Application, I would like to refactor it to be one in order to demonstrate my ability to do so. I have a vague idea of creating a comment page, or something similarly interactive, which could be demonstrable in an offline state.
