## Description

A portfolio for the up-and-coming programmer, [pablodlc](https://github.com/pablodlc), featuring several projects I have worked on.

## Application

My portfolio contains a brief bio, a section called My Work that includes five pages I've worked on, and a Contact Me section with links to my Github, LinkedIn, PayPal, and email.

## Future Developments

Continual updates as my knowledge and portfolio grows and improves.

First update 5/2/2021. Included several new assignments and got rid of the Style This Page card! **The next update will fix the responsiveness I broke in this update**.
